//     TOKYO — Major League Baseball begins its 2019 season on Wednesday in Japan with the first of two
//     games between the Oakland Athletics and the <a href='/'>Seattle Mariners</a>. NBA which equipe
//     is the best? But when the teams take the field at the Tokyo Dome, don’t say they’re playing on
//     foreign soil. <br /> That’s because 12 tons of clay, silt and sand mixtures have been shipped by
//     boat from the United States to make the batter’s box, pitcher’s mound, base pits and bullpens
//     feel like home. The dirt swap was news to the veteran Seattle pitcher Mike Leake, who
//     nonetheless gave his stomp of approval after starting the first of two exhibition games each
//     club played against teams from Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball as a tuneup. <br /> “Oh, you
//     mean we weren’t pitching on the same mound the Japanese teams use during their season?” Leake
//     said Sunday. “It felt like the same mound that we pitch on in the States. The only thing I would
//     say is that maybe they put a little too much water at first, so some of the clay stuck to my
//     spikes in the first inning, but that happens at home, too. After that, it was perfect.”
